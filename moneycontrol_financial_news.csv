This case is linked to the land deal in Shikohpur village in Gurugram, Haryana.
The notice that aims to hear from the proposed accused during the pre-cognisance stage.
Special judge Sushant Changotra issued the notice to the proposed accused persons after hearing submissions of the Enforcement Directorate (ED).
The ED has recently filed a money laundering charge sheet.
The court directed the ED to supply a copy of the charge sheet to all proposed accused persons.
Special public prosecutor (SPP) Naveen Kumar Matta, along with Mohd. Faizan and special counsel Zoheb Hossain appeared through video conferencing.
On July 24, the ED said that it is a Clear and classic case of money laundering. The Proceeds of crime was used to acquire immovable properties, the ED said during preliminary submissions on its prosecution complaint.
The ED had also stated that the evidence conclusively established the offence of money laundering, where proceeds of Crime (PoC) are generated, layered, and enjoyed.
The ED stated that we have presented the funds flow, property, and statements of witnesses. It is a Clear and classic case of money laundering, the ED added. There is a generation of proceeds of crime.
The ED submitted that during the investigation, the source of the proceeds of crime, false statements in the land deal were found, the ED said.
It was submitted that Skylight Hospitality purchased land measuring 3 acres and, valued at crores.
There were false declarations in the sale deed that Rs 7.5 crore had been paid when no money was paid. It was paid later in order to avoid stamp duty. Key witnesses corroborate this, ED's special counsel submitted.
Zoheb Hossain alleged that the first layer of proceeds of crime was generated through Skylight Hospitality, whose 99 per cent shares are held by Vadra.
Hossain submitted that Rs 7.50 crore is shown as the price of approximately 3 acres of land purchased by Skylight through a cheque which was never encashed.
This land was later sold to DLF for a higher amount. This part is still being scrutinised, the ED said.
The Application for a licence was processed in haste without following the procedure, as witnesses stated in their statement. Hossain referred to the statement of the Prosecution witness concerned with the process.
Special counsel also referred to the Statment of Satyanand Yajee, Director of Omkareshwar properties. He knowingly assisted in the generation of proceeds of crime. Yajee knowingly assisted the company of Vadra in acquiring of proceeds of crime.
The ED said that there was enjoyment of the proceeds of crime till July 2025, till the time of provisional attachment. Money Laundering continues to this day, despite the arguments. It is a continuing activity as long as the person enjoys the PoC.
The use of PoC continued through the 7 properties, which were purchased using the proceeds of crime. Enjoyment of PoC continued till the properties were attached, the ED said.
Hossain further submitted that we have also invoked section 70, as all the companies where PoC has gone are either 98% or 99% owned by Vadra.
Therefore, he is vicariously liable also apart from his individual role, the ED said.
He was the majority shareholder, beneficial owner, and actual owner, and also served as a director of companies, the ED said.
The complaint, filed on July 17, 2025, names 11 individuals and entities as accused, including Vadra, his company M/s Sky Light Hospitality Pvt. Ltd., Satyanand Yajee, and Kewal Singh Virk.
The case stems from an FIR registered by Gurugram Police, alleging that Vadra, through his company Sky Light Hospitality, fraudulently purchased 3.53 acres of land in Village Shikohpur, Sector 83, Gurugram, from Onkareshwar Properties Pvt. Ltd. on February 12, 2008.The complaint alleges the use of false declarations in the acquisition and claims that a commercial license was secured for the land using Vadra's personal influence.
As part of the ongoing probe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), the ED issued a Provisional Attachment Order on July 16, 2025, attaching 43 immovable properties worth approximately ₹37.64 crore. These properties are reportedly linked to Vadra and his associated entities, including Sky Light Hospitality."

How to file ITR 2025?,2025-08-02 12:13:00,"In today’s Ask Wallet-wise query, an NRI seeks clarity on filing returns for short-term capital gains from a Portfolio Investment Scheme (PIS) and the implications of transferring money to a resident spouse for stock investments. Our expert addresses key concerns: which ITR form to use, how capital gains for NRIs are taxed (including recent changes in tax rates), and whether gifting funds to a spouse creates any tax issues. Understanding these rules helps ensure your investment journey remains smooth and compliant.
Moneycontrol’s Ask Wallet-wise initiative brings you expert guidance on personal finance and money-related queries. If you need advice, email your questions to askwalletwise@nw18.com, and we’ll work to get a top financial expert to address your concerns.
I am an NRI. I have opened a PIS and a Demat account in my name, as well as a normal resident Demat account in my spouse’s name, who is a resident. I have transferred some money from my NRO account to my wife’s account and used this amount to purchase stocks through her resident Demat account. I earned Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) of around Rs 30,000 in the last financial year . Although the amount is small, I would like to file an ITR. Kindly advise me on how I should file my ITR. I am also doing SIPs in stocks in her name. Are there any issues regarding the funds I transfer monthly to her account considering my NRI status?
Expert Advice:As you have short-term capital gains, you are required to file ITR-2. As the short-term capital gains arose from listed equity shares and you are a non-resident, you are not entitled to set these off against any shortfall in the basic exemption limit of Rs 2.5 lakh. You will need to pay tax at 15% on the entire STCG unless tax has already been deducted at source, which is likely since brokers are required to deduct tax at source on capital gains earned by non-resident investors. For STCG earned on or after July 23, 2024, a higher tax rate of 20% will apply.
Transferring money from your account to your wife’s bank account does not conflict with your NRI status. As per current tax laws, if the aggregate value of all gifts received during a year exceeds Rs 50,000, the same is treated as income in the recipient’s hands. However, gifts received from specified relatives, including spouse, are not considered income, regardless of the amount.
The amount transferred to your wife’s account may be treated as either a gift or a loan, depending on whether repayment is intended. If it is a gift, any income your wife earns from such gifted money must be clubbed with your income as long as the marriage subsists. The clubbing provisions continue to apply even if the asset is subsequently converted into another form. However, these provisions apply only to income earned on the amount gifted, not on income from investments made out of the already clubbed income."
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/expert-columns/option-trading-for-range-bound-market-shubham-agarwal-13364809.html,Option trading for range-bound market: Shubham Agarwal,2025-08-02 11:57:00,"It is worrisome when the major index like Nifty is changed by a little over a percent in the last 3 months. The volatility has been there, but that too in a good 3-4% range. These are the times when a simple Buy and Hold strategy can get frustrating.
In such times of range-bound movement, especially, initiating a bearish trade after a big fall feels like going against the trend. The risk of indices and stocks getting back into the range is very high.
So essentially, we need a trade that does not hurt us if the very short-term trend ends right after we take the trade. At the same time, we need not miss the opportunity nor be too protective.
Detect a range-bound market with the following 3 characteristics visible in the equities market.
1. The Highs and Lows made a few weeks back have not been broken (and sustained)2. Open Interest in Nifty Calls and Puts is almost equal (Publicly available information on NSE website)3. India VIX has dropped in the last few weeksAs soon as it is established, we can treat and trade such market conditions like a range-bound market.
Put a Butterfly in place in Nifty
Creating this strategy is simple. Sell Both Call & Put of a strike closest to the current level of the index. Being an index, it is likely to be less volatile, and liquidity is enough as well. However, since selling options has an unknown risk profile, we will add a couple of more options to this.
I always buy Protection. Along with the Sell Options, Buy a Higher Strike Call Option and a Lower Strike Put Option. An easy way to choose the strike is that the difference between the Buy strikes could be equal to the total premium received by selling options.
Index at 1000Sell 1000 Call @ 50Sell 1000 Put @ 50Total Premium received 100Buy 1100 Call & Buy 900 Put for Protection.
Maximum Profit would be the net premium received, and maximum Loss would be the difference between Buy strike & Sell Strike minus the Net Premium received. It’s always better to get this economics right before entering the trade.
As far as individual stocks are concerned, we can resort to options there as well. However, we need to keep in mind that there will be a lack of big moves, so adjust the trades accordingly. Also, care must be taken for the fact that stocks and indices could keep moving down from the upper end of the range and moving up from the lower end.
To handle this:1. While trading stock options, we could keep our price target and stop losses smaller.2. Take trades in single Options (Buy Call/Put) for 1 -2 days3. When we are close to a recent high, have a mix of Buy Call & Buy Put (Bullish & Bearish) trades
Range-bound market has an attractive characteristic of not having to commit to the trade for a longer period. History says that many small trades do improve the probability of profit. So, range-bound markets are also equally profitable if traded effectively using Options."

Also weighing on equities was an 8.3% tumble in Amazon.com shares after the company posted quarterly results but failed to meet lofty expectations for its Amazon Web Services cloud computing unit.
Just hours before the tariff deadline on Friday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order imposing duties on U.S. imports from countries, including Canada, Brazil, India and Taiwan, in his latest round of levies as countries attempted to seek ways to reach better deals.
Further denting confidence in the economic picture, data showed U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in July while the prior month's report was revised sharply lower, indicating the labor market may be starting to crack.
The report significantly pushed up expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its September meeting.
""There’s no way to pretty-up this report. Previous months were revised significantly lower where the labor market has been on stall-speed,"" said Brian Jacobsen, Chief Economist at Annex Wealth Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.
""Last year the Fed messed up by not cutting in July so they did a catch-up cut at their next meeting. They’ll likely have to do the same thing this year.""

For the week, the S&P 500 fell 2.36%, the Nasdaq declined 2.17%, and the Dow fell 2.92%.
The CBOE Volatility Index, also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, closed up 3.66 points at 20.38, its highest close since June 20.

Also reporting earnings was Apple which lost 2.5% after it posted a current-quarter revenue forecast well above Wall Street estimates, but CEO Tim Cook warned U.S. tariffs would add $1.1 billion in costs over the period.
Stocks briefly extended declines after Trump said he ordered the commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika L. McEntarfer, to be fired in the wake of the jobs data.
""(Trump) didn't seem to be disappointed with the last five jobs reports,"" said Art Hogan, Chief Market Strategist, B. Riley Wealth, Boston, saying that the firing stood out as irregular.
""I think this is clearly something that happens in dictatorships, not in democracies.”
The Federal Reserve said Governor Adriana Kugler is resigning early from her term and will exit the central bank on Aug. 8, enabling President Donald Trump to select a new governor as he has ramped up pressure against Chair Jerome Powell recently to cut interest rates.

Rising US-Russia tensions threaten global supply, spark brent crude price surge forecast",2025-08-02 10:58:00,"Brent crude prices are poised to climb to $80–82 per barrel by end-2025, with short-term movements already showing signs of an upswing. Analysts cite escalating US-Russia tensions as a key trigger.
N S Ramaswamy, Head of Commodities & CRM at Ventura, told ANI that Brent (October 2025 contract) has already moved from $72.07 to near $76, with downside support at $69. He expects prices to hover between $80 and $82 by year-end.
“The momentum is being driven by the threat of US sanctions on nations trading with Russia. If enforced, it could severely disrupt global oil flows,” he noted.
Trump’s 12-day deadline to Russia fuels price surge fears
What’s causing the oil market anxiety? President Donald Trump has reportedly given Russia a 10–12 day ultimatum to halt its Ukraine offensive. Failure to comply could trigger 100% secondary tariffs on countries continuing oil trade with Russia.
That’s a massive threat to the global supply chain, especially considering Russia exports nearly 5 million barrels per day, energy analyst Narendra Taneja told ANI.
“If Russian oil is forced out, prices could spike to $100–$120 per barrel, possibly more,” he said, warning of a ripple effect on countries like India that heavily rely on Russian crude.
Indian refineries may face cost pressure, but not supply shortage
India may not face an immediate shortage of crude oil, thanks to diversified imports from over 40 countries. However, managing retail fuel prices could become increasingly difficult.
“Even if we manage supply, consumer pricing will be the key challenge,” said Taneja.
Similar trends are expected in the WTI crude market. Experts forecast a jump from the current level of $69.65 to $73 in the short term, with a year-end target of $76–79. The downside support sits around $65.
The oil market is already dealing with tight spare production capacity, and any sudden supply cuts, especially from a major player like Russia, could trigger a global oil deficit.
Even if Saudi Arabia or OPEC+ step in, ramping up output takes time due to infrastructure and manpower limitations. That lag could amplify short-term price pressures.
Interestingly, while Trump seeks lower oil prices for domestic political reasons, experts say the US can't boost production fast enough to calm the market.
Market also tracking US inventories, Fed’s rate call
Adding to the volatility, investors are closely watching the US Federal Reserve’s upcoming interest rate decision and domestic inventory data, both of which influence oil futures.
A stronger US dollar has kept some check on prices, but that may not be enough to offset geopolitical risk.
Trade deals offer some relief, but risks remain
The recent US-EU trade agreement and extended US-China truce have stabilised some sentiment, but the underlying risks in the oil sector remain elevated.
If Russian supply is taken off the table and OPEC+ doesn’t increase production, the world could see a major supply crunch, pushing prices well beyond current projections."
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/earnings/brookfield-india-reit-q1-net-operating-income-rises-13-occupancy-hits-89-amid-leasing-surge-13374987.html,"Brookfield India REIT Q1 net operating income rises 13%, occupancy hits 89% amid leasing surge",2025-08-02 10:41:00,"Brookfield India Real Estate Trust (BIRET) has reported a strong start to FY26, driven by healthy leasing activity, higher occupancy, and growth in distributions. For the quarter ended June 30, 2025, income from operating lease rentals rose 9 percent year-on-year to Rs 4,583 million, while net operating income (NOI) increased 13 percent to Rs 4,986 million, the company said in a press release. The company announced a distribution of Rs 5.25 per unit, totaling Rs 3,190 million, up 17 percent from the year-ago quarter.
During the quarter, BIRET achieved gross leasing of 651,000 square feet with an average re-leasing spread of 22 percent. Committed occupancy climbed to 89 percent, marking an improvement of nearly 9 percent over the past 18 months since SEZ reforms were announced. Across property segments including SEZs, non-processing areas, and IT/commercial spaces, the REIT has delivered 4.6 million square feet of gross leasing.
Alok Aggarwal, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Brookfield India Real Estate Trust, said the REIT continues to benefit from steady demand for its assets across key markets. “The fiscal year began on a strong note with healthy leasing momentum, robust occupancy levels, and continued growth in distributions. We expect to grow occupancy to more than 95 percent, driving around 13 percent growth in NOI and 22 percent growth in distribution over the current quarter. Our proposed fundraise of Rs 10 billion through preferential issue will further strengthen our ability to pursue large growth opportunities,” he said.
The board has approved, subject to unitholder approval, a preferential issue of Rs 10 billion to a mix of investors such as corporate treasuries, family offices, and high-net-worth individuals. This capital raise, combined with Rs 35 billion raised in December 2024, will enhance the REIT’s capacity to pursue large-scale growth plans.
Looking ahead, BIRET is in talks with its sponsor group for the potential acquisition of dominant Grade A properties in Bangalore and Chennai. With a dual AAA credit rating and 88 percent of borrowings linked to repo rates, the REIT is set to benefit from the lower interest rate environment, the company said in a press statement.
A 35 basis point rate cut on borrowings has already been implemented, and another 55 basis point reduction is expected to be fully transmitted in Q2 FY26. Further growth is anticipated from leasing vacant spaces, market-to-market rent adjustments, and contractual escalations, which are expected to boost both NOI and distributions in the coming quarters."
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/moneycontrol-pro-weekender-tariffs-and-tensions-has-the-us-india-bond-fractured-13369863.html,Moneycontrol Pro Weekender | Tariffs and Tensions: Has the US-India bond fractured?,2025-08-02 09:46:00,"Trump's tariffs have finally hit India. Not that he has singled us out for particularly harsh treatment. South Africa has been hit with 30 percent tariffs, perhaps as punishment because Trump imagines there's a white genocide happening there, Canada faces 35 percent for not cracking down on fictional fentanyl shipments to the US, Laos gets 40 percent God knows why, Bosnia Herzegovina-- with whom the US had a trade deficit of a mere USD 126 million in 2024--has been slapped with 30 percent tariffs, and Switzerland faces a 39 percent tariff, perhaps because its cuckoo clocks have been taken as a personal insult by the US president. It's a circus.
Nevertheless, the 25 percent tariff on India is high because the baseline tariff is now 15 percent, applicable to most nations. In addition, Trump has threatened to impose penalties because India has been buying Russian oil and defence equipment. What on earth happened to the special relationship India was supposed to have with the US? What does the US leader's cosying up to Pakistan mean—Trump signalled a deal to develop Pakistan's so-called oil reserves, and its tariff rate of 19 percent is well below India's. Could it be a pressure tactic to get India to sign a deal that has big advantages for the US?
These tariff blitzes have broughtUS levies to their highest levels since the 1930s, a sobering reminder of the protectionist spiral that preceded the Great Depression. Yet paradoxically, theIMF has turned suddenly bullish on global growtheven as tariff wars rage across continents, due to a combination of firms trying to stock up inventory ahead of the tariffs taking effect and loose financial conditions.
That could be a reason why the initial reaction of the markets has been rather muted. Perhaps they anticipate that India will soon manage a better deal—we wrote‘In Trump’s own words, the US is “talking to India now,” and that “we’ll see what happens.” This indicates that there is room for a rollback.’ Market experts suggest thetariff impact is already priced in, and we worked out the impact on various sectors and stocks, andat what level it becomes a buying opportunity. So far,domestic institutional investors have kept the faith, with equity inflows crossing Rs 4 lakh crore so far this year—the second-highest since 2007—even asglobal funds like GQG, BlackRock, and Invesco see massive outflowsfrom emerging market funds.
The currency implications are particularly stark. Trump's tariff bomb threatens to deala blow to the Rupee, forcing the RBI into a delicate balancing act asthe Fed maintains its hard line.
Energy security remains a critical vulnerability. India'scontinued purchase of Russian oilhas triggered Trump's penalty threats, raising fundamental questions about whether India can avoid secondary sanctions while maintaining strategic autonomy. This dilemma crystallizes India's broader challenge—it canneither give in completely to American pressure nor give upits independent foreign policy.
Additional signs of a macro slowdown in India emerged this week. Manufacturing tells a sobering tale with10 out of 23 sectors still producing below pre-COVID levels, even as government capex rises sharply, suggesting public investment is compensating for private sector hesitancy. Data for the April-June quarter on central government finances showed asharp decline in gross tax revenues, indicating an economic slowdown.
This slowdown is reflected inlower domestic volumes at Maruti, inDabur’s volume de-growth, inDalmia Bharat’s flat Q1 volumes. However, there will always be companies that will buck the trend, and we saw volume growth in HUL in the last quarter, as we pointed outhereandhere. AndShriram Finance’s resultsindicate growing demand in the rural market.
The silver lining is that India is having a good monsoon, inflation is low, services exports are strong, as are forex reserves—asthis articletell us, domestic strengths trump global uncertainty. Also, there is scope for further relaxation in monetary policy, as we wrotehere.
The corporate earnings season tells a more nuanced story. Companies are navigating the uncertainty with mixed results.Mahindra & Mahindrais shifting to a higher gear, whilethis defence sector companyis poised for strong revenue growth, perhaps benefiting from the very geopolitical tensions that are reshaping trade flows. Some indicators suggest thatthe commercial vehicle sectoris coming out of its slump.
Companies are adapting to the new realities.TCS's cost rationalization strategyaddresses immediate challenges, though growth recovery remains uncertain. Indeed,employee attrition had been ticking upeven before the current wave of layoffs. Globally, amid uncertainties about AI investments,Big Tech's mammoth spending on the AI arms racehas begun to show potential pay-offs for investors. Thedisconnect between layoffs and fund manager confidence in IT stocksreveals how markets are pricing in long-term transformation over short-term disruption.Tata Steelis steering through a challenging global steel environment by focusing on cost transformation, green technology integration, and prudent capital allocation.
The real estate market showscontinuing optimismwith realty developers confident of steady demand in premium and luxury homes. It is in this context that Sri Lotus Developers & Realty Ltd, which is focused on high margin luxury redevelopment projects, has come out with its IPO, which we analysedhere.Real estate has also been driven by domestic liquidity and the search for inflation hedges asgold prices maintain their glitter.
The challenge for India is clear: it mustseize the moment for a comprehensive trade dealwith the US while maintaining its diverse partnerships, strengthen domestic manufacturing capabilities while remaining globally competitive, and navigate the currency pressures while keeping inflation expectations anchored.Whether Indian companies will thrive, survive, or flailin this new tariff dawn depends not just on government policy responses, but on their ability to adapt business models to a world where economic logic increasingly takes a backseat to political calculations.
The circus may be mad, but the show must go on.Do read about the three factorsthat are likely to guide the course of the market in the near term.

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/how-misinformation-aims-at-thwarting-the-india-uk-fta-13374843.html,How misinformation aims at thwarting the India-UK FTA,2025-08-02 08:19:00,"India recently concluded a free trade agreement (FTA) with the United Kingdom (UK), and this marks a historic milestone in the bilateral relationship between the two vibrant democracies. While it is poised to unlock immense economic potential, misinformation around it has already begun. In the Internet Age that the 21st century lives in, the malicious impacts of misinformation or disinformation are myriad and cannot be ignored. Misinformation on FTAs in particular, like exaggerated claims of economic harm or job losses erode public trust and political support, jeopardizing successful implementation and the benefits of such partnerships and agreements.
While the landmark deal between India and the UK, built on mutual trust and shared ambitions, promises to boost trade, foster innovation and create more and newer opportunities for businesses and communities in both the countries, misinformation on the intellectual property (IP) chapter of the India-UK FTA has already started doing the rounds.
The narrative pushed out on some prominent news portals as well as on social media is that the IP chapter of the FTA undermines India’s policy space to ensure access to medicines. However, the narratives are misplaced and not reflective of the actual provisions of the agreement.
Contrary to the narrative that there will be a reduced access to medicines, the IP chapter of the FTA represents a balanced and forward looking approach that is fully aligned with India’s legal framework, TRIPS flexibilities and public health priorities. While the FTA aims at strengthening cooperation, it preserves India’s sovereign rights in matters of patent policy and access to essential medicines. Quick searches reveal that the narrative is not something new.
In 2022, emanating from “news” around the leakage of the draft proposal from the UK of the UK-India FTA’s chapter of the IP chapter, the narrative was the exact same as it is in 2025, after signing of the FTA- that the UK has tabled harmful provisions that threaten to tighten the screws on producing, supplying and exporting affordable generic medicines from India. The exact same lines have actually been copy pasted in some news reports, from some of what are considered the most credible news organisations in India.
On April 7 this year, individuals from the Trade Justice Movement, Global Justice Now and Health Poverty Action, among others had written to Jonathan Reynolds, of the Department for Business and Trade in the UK with similar concerns, that in April 2022, a document that appeared to be a draft IP chapter of the UK-India FTA was leaked and that the chapter contained text, to which, if agreed and enacted could require India to change its national IP laws, with devastating consequences for India’s ability to produce life saving drugs. While this particular letter, might have been out of genuine concern, the fact remains that media houses in India and social media handles seemingly operating out of India have readily picked up the narrative, without cross checking the facts of the FTA from the Indian side and peddled narratives.
While it is understandable that the Information Age has also led to clickbait journalism, wherein profits from clicks, likes, shares and subscribes are greater than ethics, yellow journalism is what it has come down to, and actual reporting, with conscience and ethics clearly do not matter anymore.
In the India-UK FTA, the reference to voluntary licensing simply acknowledges global best practices that encourage collaborative solutions. It does not limit or dilute India’s well-established right to issue compulsory licences (CLs) under Section 84 of the Indian Patents Act, 1970, consistent with the TRIPS Agreement and reaffirmed in the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health. Only one CL has been issued so far—for the cancer drug Nexavar (2012)—and that too under exceptional public health circumstances.The FTA does not create any new precondition for issuing CLs. The sovereign authority to issue such licenses remains entirely with the Government of India, as per existing law.
What is additionally odd, that in the Chinese language cyber space, similar narratives are being peddled. While it is difficult to ascertain where the narrative to dilute the achievements of the FTA have actually emanated from, fact remains that responsible journalism needs more work than copy pasting narratives from foreign sources, without conducting fact checks, or without reading the actual provisions of the FTA.
For India and the UK, while the signing of the FTA has been a historic moment, fact remains that for both, there will be mobilisation in their democratic civil societies to thwart the positives of the FTA. Misinformation and disinformation will emerge in bigger ways. The best way to counter it is to pre-empt and ensure easily understandable information is made available on the FTA.

In the monthly newsletter, the company noted that it was the first asset management company in India to receive approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to launch a Specialized Investment Fund (SIF).
The fund house’s maiden offering under this category, the QSIF Equity Long-Short Fund, is scheduled for launch in August 2025.
Quant Mutual Fund has also hinted at additional equity and hybrid SIF products in the pipeline over the coming months. Alongside product launches, the company plans to roll out investor education initiatives to build awareness around the nuances and potential of SIFs.
Apart from Quant other fund houses like ITI, Edelweiss, DSP, SBI have received approval to launch SIFs but are yet to announce their products.
The SIF is a new category of investment product introduced by SEBI to bridge the gap between Mutual Funds (MFs) and Portfolio Management Services (PMS).
The regulator believes that while over the years, India's financial market has witnessed an expansion in investment products with varying degrees of risk, complexity, and regulatory oversight, a gap exists between mutual funds and PMS. SIFs aim to provide a middle ground, offering portfolio flexibility while ensuring regulatory compliance and investor protection.
The minimum investment thresholds of SIFs is lower at Rs 10 lakh thereby drawing in mass affluent investors who may be seeking more than just traditional mutual fund products."
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/commodities/indian-refiner-snaps-up-us-oil-after-trump-s-russia-threats-13374623.html,Indian refiner snaps up US oil after Trump’s Russia threats,2025-08-02 07:13:00,"India’s largest oil refiner has snapped up millions of barrels of crude from the US and United Arab Emirates, with the South Asian nation facing mounting pressure from Washington and Europe over its purchases from Russia.
State-owned Indian Oil Corp. bought at least 5 million barrels US crude, on top of 2 million barrels of supplies from Abu Dhabi, according to traders who asked not to be identified as they aren’t authorised to speak publicly. The purchases were both large and for relatively immediate delivery by the company’s usual standards. State-owned processors were told to come up with plans for buying non-Russian crude earlier this week.
An Indian Oil spokesman didn’t respond to a request for comment.
India’s refiners have been in the spotlight over the past two weeks, after being singled out by the European Union and the US for supporting Moscow during its war in Ukraine by buying Russian oil. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose secondary tariffs on buyers of Russian oil, and in a post earlier this week singled out India for criticism, saying that it would pay an additional economic penalty for its ongoing purchases.
“We are interpreting the increased buying activity from India as a sign of diversification away from Russian supply,” said Livia Gallarati, global crude lead at consultant Energy Aspects. “Physical players are unlikely to gamble on buying Russian barrels, especially at current high prices, even if skepticism remains over whether US President Donald Trump will follow through with these threats.”
This week, IOC sought crude supplies in multiple back-to-back purchase tenders, which traders said was unusual for the company and pointed to relatively urgent demand for crude. Earlier in the week, it also purchased 4 million barrels of West African barrels, as well as the UAE’s Murban crude for delivery during the same period.
India has become the world’s biggest buyer of Russian seaborne exports of crude, soaking up discounted barrels and ramping up its purchases from almost zero to about one-third of its imports. This has come from streams such as Urals crude, and at the expense of more traditional supplies from the Middle East and Africa.
The country’s refiners can currently make about $3 a barrel more by purchasing US supplies rather than Murban for cargoes arriving in November, Gallarati added.
“The stronger Indian buying of Atlantic Basin crude is definitely supportive of prices,” she said."

""This week’s negotiations in Stockholm have advanced our talks with China, and I believe that we have the makings of a deal that will benefit both of our great nations,"" Bessent said in a post on X that was subsequently deleted.
""I am optimistic about the path forward,"" he added.
A Treasury Department spokesperson said the post was being reposted because the images attached to it had not uploaded correctly. The spokesperson also noted that the language in the post was in line with what Bessent had said in various media interviews this week.
In an interview withCNBCon Thursday, Bessent said the United States believes it has the makings of a trade deal with China, but it is ""not 100% done.""
U.S. negotiators ""pushed back quite a bit"" over two days of trade talks with the Chinese in Stockholm this week, Bessent toldCNBC.
China is facing an August 12 deadline to reach a durable tariff agreement with President Donald Trump’s administration, after Beijing and Washington reached preliminary deals in May and June to end escalating tit-for-tat tariffs and a cut-off of rare earth minerals."
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/musk-s-x-must-face-part-of-lawsuit-over-child-pornography-video-13374608.html,Musk's X must face part of lawsuit over child pornography video,2025-08-02 07:04:00,"A federal appeals court on Friday revived part of a lawsuit accusing Elon Musk’s X of becoming a haven for child exploitation, though the court said the platform deserves broad immunity from claims over objectionable content.
While rejecting some claims, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said X, formerly Twitter, must face a claim it was negligent by failing to promptly report a video containing explicit images of two underage boys to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).
The case predated Musk’s 2022 purchase of Twitter. A trial judge had dismissed the case in December 2023. X’s lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Musk was not a defendant.
One plaintiff, John Doe 1, said he was 13 when he and a friend, John Doe 2, were lured on SnapChat into providing nude photos of themselves to someone John Doe 1 thought was a 16-year-old girl at his school.
The SnapChat user was actually a child pornography trafficker who blackmailed the plaintiffs into providing additional explicit photos. Those images were later compiled into a video that was posted on Twitter.
According to court papers, Twitter took nine days after learning about the content to take it down and report it to NCMEC, following more than 167,000 views, court papers showed.
Circuit Judge Danielle Forrest said section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act, which protects online platforms from liability over user content, didn’t shield X from the negligence claim once it learned about the pornography.
""The facts alleged here, coupled with the statutory ’actual knowledge’ requirement, separates the duty to report child pornography to NCMEC from Twitter’s role as a publisher,"" she wrote for a three-judge panel.
X must also face a claim that its infrastructure made it too difficult to report child pornography.
It was found immune from claims it knowingly benefited from sex trafficking, and created search features that ""amplify"" child pornography posts.
Dani Pinter, a lawyer at the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, which represented the plaintiffs, said in a statement: ""We look forward to discovery and ultimately trial against X to get justice and accountability.""
The case is Doe 1 et al v Twitter Inc et al, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 24-177."
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ipo/avenue-capital-group-backed-arcil-files-ipo-papers-with-100-offer-for-sale-component-13374325.html,Avenue Capital Group-backed Arcil files IPO papers with 100% offer for sale component,2025-08-02 06:58:00,"US-based Avenue Capital Group-backed Arcil, the India's first asset reconstruction company (ARC) with second largest AUM, has filed preliminary papers with the SEBI to raise funds via initial share sale. Also, it is the first to approach capital markets for fund raising via IPO.
The IPO comprises of entirely an offer-for-sale of 10.54 crore shares by existing shareholders - Avenue India Resurgence Pte, State Bank of India, Lathe Investment Pte, and Federal Bank.
Hence, the company, which acquires bad debts or non-performing assets from banks and financial institutions, will not receive any money. All the IPO proceeds will go to the selling shareholders.
Moneycontrol was the first to report in May this year thatArcil is gearing up to go public and has initiated work on preparing the draft red herring prospectus for its proposed initial public offering which could be of Rs 1,000-1,500 crore size.
Incorporated in 2002, Asset Reconstruction Company India Limited (Arcil) with AUM of Rs 16,852.6 crore operates across India through a network of 13 offices across 12 states (including Delhi), and acquires stressed assets (non-performing assets) from banks and financial institutions. Further, it implements resolution strategies through restructuring, enforcement of rights over underlying securities, and settlements aimed at maximizing recovery and optimizing the value of stressed assets to generate revenue streams.
So far till March 2025, it had acquired Rs 72,657.3 crore in total principal debt at a cost of Rs 38,155.6 crore or 52.51 percent of the total principal debt and had made recoveries of Rs 28,459.8 crore.
Avenue India Resurgence Pte, owned by New York-headquartered global investment firm Avenue Capital Group, holds 69.73 percent shareholding in Arcil. Further, 19.95 percent stake is owned by State Bank of India. Both are promoters of the company.
Public shareholders include Lathe Investment (owned by Singapore-based GIC Ventures), Federal Bank, South Indian Bank, and Karnataka Bank have 10.18 percent shareholding.
Lathe Investment acquired 9.9 percent stake in Arcil through preferential allotment in 2008. Of which, 4.9 percent shares were sold to Avenue India Resurgence in April 2019.
Avenue Capital (through Avenue India Resurgence), founded in 1995 by Marc Lasry and Sonia Garnder, first picked up stake in Arcil in March 2019 from shareholders like Karur Vysya Bank, Barclays Bank, Quiveo Enterprises, Cyprus, HDFC Bank, and IDFC Bank. And over the years, it gradually increased stake up to 69.73 percent through major stakes acquisition like 19.18 percent from IDBI Bank, 13.26 percent from ICICI Bank, and 10 percent from Punjab National Bank (which was the last happened in March 2023).
In the last fiscal year 2025, Arcil recorded profit at Rs 355.3 crore, growing 16.4 percent from Rs 305.3 crore in the previous year. Revenue in FY25 increased by 4.6 percent to Rs 596.4 crore, up from Rs 570.1 crore in the fiscal 2024.
IIFL Capital Services, IDBI Capital Markets & Securities, and JM Financial are appointed as the merchant banker for managing the Arcil IPO."
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/daily-voice-trump-risks-long-term-damage-to-us-by-targeting-india-trade-says-cio-13374208.html,"Daily Voice: Trump risks long-term damage to US by targeting India trade, says CIO",2025-08-02 06:52:00,"Aniruddha Sarkar, the CIO and Portfolio Manager at Quest Investment Advisors believes the US will eventually strike a deal with India and both sides will give away some ground.
According to him, Trump cannot jeopardise trade with the world's 4th largest economy and largest populated country. It would harm US more than India in the medium to long run, he said.
He feels a big risk factor which Mr Trump is completely ignoring now is that high-tariff countries will find a way to gang up against the US. And that would hurt US growth and have a similar impact on global growth, he said in an interview with Moneycontrol.
Considering the tariff revisions effective from the August 1 deadline, do you think most of the major announcements have already been made? What are the potential implications for US growth and inflation, as well as for global economic growth?
So far, we are hearing more of country specific tariff numbers which itself are subject to changes. For example, Canada which was earlier subjected to 25% is now suddenly at 35% tariff. Also, what is to be seen is that how non-trade factors become deciding factors like India's support of Russia and continued trade with Russia.
Hence, difficult to say where the final ball will stop at. Having said that definitely there would be impact on US consumer inflation which might raise its head after a few quarters. Moreover, a big risk factor which Mr Trump is completely ignoring now is that high tariffed countries will find a way to gang up against the US and that would definitely hurt US growth and see similar impact on global growth.
With the consistent delay in the India–US trade deal and the imposition of a 25 percent tariff on India after a long wait, do you think the US is now desperate for a deal with India?
The US had come to the negotiation table with India thinking it would be an easy cakewalk but then got served a hard bargain so it’s evident they are bit frustrated with it. India stood its ground and didn’t relent is very praiseworthy. Nevertheless, US will eventually strike a deal with India and both sides will give away some ground, because you cannot jeopardise trade with the world’s 4th largest economy and largest populated country. It would harm US more than India in the medium to long run and they understand that.
Do you see any major implications of the 25 percent tariff on India’s government balance sheet?
With US exports contributing just 2% of our GDP, I don’t see the increased tariff impacting government balance sheet in any way in the medium to long term. Global trade is finding a new equilibrium and so would India with its FTA and Trade Agreements with other countries also find new markets to cater to.
Moreover 25% tariff seems a median rate when we see what various large trading partners have been charged with. All the more the rates seem very fluid and not permanent as we have seen in some recent cases.
Do you expect the government to take additional measures to support the economy, which is likely to feel the impact of the new tariffs?
I don’t think there is any such major direct big impact which is expected overnight for which the government would be required to step in with some support measures. Meanwhile the government has committed to continue the trade talks with US to find better future for our MSME and Small businesses in sectors which could get see some adverse impact. Looking for alternate trading partners and markets is the best way the government can support the affected industries if it happens.
Considering that 25 percent appears to be the final ceiling, do you think the tariff-related news is now behind us? What could be the next major triggers for the market?
I don’t think the 25% tariff is the final number we would hear in the coming weeks. Things coming out of Washington continues to be very fluid and numbers change every day. Equity markets are gradually factoring in such tariff-based news flow and gradually the major trigger for the markets would move to earnings growth in India Inc. which has been the biggest worry for last few quarters.
Earnings upgrades across various industries and market cap companies would become the next major trigger for the markets.
Do you believe the RBI has done enough to support economic growth and will likely hold interest rates in the next few meetings to observe the impact of previous policy actions?
RBI has once again shown its proactive actions in cutting rates ahead of the US Fed and has also infused a lot of liquidity in the economy through various policy announcements in the last several months. This has definitely provided the much need gunpowder to take the economy higher as negative macro headwinds globally recede. Further rate cuts from these levels are possible as RBI along with government is focussed on driving the lending growth which could drive the capex cycle again.
Is there a risk of FII outflows if the ongoing monetary easing does not translate into a meaningful pickup in credit growth in the coming months?
FII outflows could happen not because of monetary policy but because of US economy continuing to do better than anticipated and dollar strengthening. At the same time, I am confident that we would see a revival in stronger private capex upcycle in the next four to six quarters and that would drive the credit growth in the system."
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/markets/chartist-talk-this-vp-shares-2-buy-and-2-sell-picks-amid-market-caution-nifty-at-risk-below-24-400-13373897.html,"Chartist Talk: This VP shares 2 buy and 2 sell picks amid market caution; Nifty at risk below 24,400",2025-08-02 06:47:00,"The Nifty now traded below its 20-day, 50-day, and even 100-day EMA, and daily RSI fell below the 40 mark, signalling the bearish sentiment. Hence, the caution is advised and the 24,400-24,350 is expected to be crucial for further downside in the Nifty 50, said Sudeep Shah, Vice President and Head of Technical and Derivative Research at SBI Securities in an interview to Moneycontrol.
Amid market caution, he advised two buy (Emami and Jindal Stainless) and two sell picks (Tata Steel and Aurobindo Pharma) for the next week.
With this week's rally, Emami has managed to reclaim both its short-term and long-term moving averages, reinforcing the positive shift in momentum, while on Friday, Jindal Stainless gave a Symmetrical Triangle breakout on the daily scale which is confirmed by robust volume.
Further, Aurobindo Pharma on Friday has given an upward sloping trendline breakdown on a daily scale accompained by robust volume, while Tata Steel slipped below its 100-day EMA level on Friday, which is a bearish sign, Sudeep reasoned.
Do you see the Nifty easily breaking below its 200-day EMA in the coming week?
The benchmark index Nifty wrapped up its fifth consecutive week in the red — its longest losing streak since August 2023, raising eyebrows across the street. What adds to the concern is the back-to-back formation of bearish candles with long upper shadows on the weekly chart. This pattern is a classic sign of rejection at higher levels. Despite making multiple attempts to scale up, the index has struggled to hold ground, only to be met with selling pressure each time. The long upper wicks are a telling story — bulls tried, but bears had the final say. It reflects a market that’s finding it hard to build on gains, weighed down by renewed supply pressure, and a cautious sentiment hovering overhead.
Several factors have contributed to this shift in tone — from renewed concerns around the progress of India–US trade negotiations, to persistent FII outflows, and a string of underwhelming corporate earnings that failed to meet market expectations.
The broader markets weren’t spared either. Both the Nifty Midcap and Nifty Small Cap 100 indices came under notable selling pressure and have now underperformed the frontline index for the second consecutive week. Adding to the concern, the ratio charts comparing these broader indices to the Nifty have slipped to their lowest levels in nearly two months, pointing to deteriorating relative strength and increasing caution among market participants when it comes to mid and small-cap exposures.
Technically, Nifty is now trading below its 20-day, 50-day, and even 100-day EMA — a sign of mounting weakness. The daily RSI has dipped below the 40 mark and continues to trend lower, reinforcing the underlying bearish momentum. Talking about key levels, the zone of 24,400–24,350 is expected to act as an immediate support for Nifty. A sustained break below this could further accelerate the downside. On the flip side, the 50-day EMA zone of 24,900–24,950 now stands as a crucial hurdle, and any meaningful recovery would need to clear this zone with conviction.
Looking at the medium-term structure, the 24,000–23,900 zone holds even greater significance. This area is likely to serve as a vital support base, and any breach below it could lead to a deeper corrective phase in the index.
Despite its recent outperformance relative to the Nifty 50, do you expect the Bank Nifty to extend its downtrend and test the June lows as well as the 100-day EMA?
The banking benchmark index, Bank Nifty, traded within a narrow range of 2,081 points during July — its tightest monthly range since July 2023. After posting gains for four consecutive months, the index finally snapped its winning streak and closed the July month on a negative note. On the monthly chart, Bank Nifty has formed a bearish candle, indicating a loss of momentum and a potential pause in the prevailing uptrend.
At present, the index is trading below both its 20-day and 50-day exponential moving averages, with both averages exhibiting a downward slope — a sign of prevailing weakness. Additionally, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has slipped below the 40 mark and continues to trend lower, reflecting fading momentum and increasing bearish pressure. The daily MACD stays bearish as it is quoting below its zero line and signal line. The MACD histogram is suggesting a pickup in downside momentum.
Going ahead, the zone of 55,200-55,100 will act as an important support for the index. If the index slips below the 55,100 level, then the next crucial support is placed at the 54,600 level. On the upside, the zone of 56,300-56,400 will act as an immediate hurdle for the index.
Do you anticipate the rally in Suzlon Energy and Kaynes Technology India to continue in the coming week?
Yes, based on the recent price action and technical indicators, the rally in both Suzlon Energy and Kaynes Technology India appears poised to extend into the coming week. During the previous week, both stocks took strong support near their respective 200-day EMA — a key long-term trend indicator closely tracked by market participants. This support acted as a springboard for a sharp and decisive rebound.
What adds conviction to this recovery is the surge in trading volumes, which confirms that the rebound is backed by strong market participation and not merely a technical pullback. Moreover, both counters are now trading comfortably above their key short and medium-term moving averages, reinforcing the strength of the ongoing uptrend.
In addition, momentum indicators such as the RSI and MACD are showing signs of continued bullish traction, indicating sustained buying interest. Given these favourable technical signals, we expect both Suzlon Energy and Kaynes Technology India to maintain their positive momentum and continue to outperform in the short term, provided broader market conditions remain stable.
Which two stocks would you prefer to bet on for the upcoming week?
The Nifty FMCG has strongly outperformed frontline indices in the last week. The stock of Emami has found strong support near its upward-sloping trendline, which has been intact since April 2023 by connecting key swing lows. Following this retest, the stock witnessed a sharp upside rally, indicating a solid reversal from the support zone — a move that was further validated by robust volume participation, adding strength to the price action.
With this upmove, the stock has managed to reclaim both its short-term and long-term moving averages, reinforcing the positive shift in momentum. Additionally, the daily RSI has surged past the 60 mark and is trending higher, signaling growing bullish strength and increasing buying interest. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 620-615 level with a stop-loss of Rs 595 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 660 in the short term.
On Friday, the stock gave a Symmetrical Triangle breakout on the daily scale. This breakout is confirmed by robust volume. Currently, the stock is trading above its short and long-term moving averages. These averages are in rising mode, and they are in the desired sequence, which reinforces the strength of the ongoing trend.
The daily RSI has surged above the 60 mark, and it is in rising mode, suggesting sustained momentum and increasing bullish sentiment. Hence, we recommend accumulating the stock in the zone of Rs 710-700 level with a stop-loss of Rs 680 level. On the upside, it is likely to test the level of Rs 760 in the short term.
Are you particularly bullish on GE Vernova T&D and Radico Khaitan, given their continued higher highs and higher low formation? What are your price targets for both in August?
While GE Vernova T&D has displayed remarkable strength in recent sessions, locking in upper circuits for the past three consecutive trading days. Going ahead, it is important to exercise caution at this juncture. The stock has already witnessed a steep vertical rally, and its daily RSI is now approaching the overbought territory, indicating stretched short-term momentum. In such scenarios, the risk-reward becomes unfavourable for fresh entries. Hence, we advise avoiding any immediate exposure to the stock until it cools off or offers a healthy consolidation.
Radico Khaitan has shown encouraging technical strength by breaking out of a consolidation pattern on the daily chart in Friday’s session. The breakout was supported by decent volumes, which is a positive sign. However, after touching an intraday high of Rs 2,940, the stock faced some profit booking, ultimately forming a bullish candle with a long upper shadow. This suggests selling pressure at higher levels.
For the stock to resume its upward trajectory convincingly, it must sustain above Rs 2,900 mark. If that level is reclaimed and held, we expect Radico Khaitan to potentially move towards Rs 3,025–3,075 in August, provided market sentiment remains supportive.
Considering the current market weakness, are there any two stocks you'd look to short in the coming week, and what’s your rationale?
The stock has strongly underperformed the Nifty Pharma index in the last couple of months. On Friday, the stock has given an upward sloping trendline breakdown on a daily scale. This breakdown is confirmed by robust volume. Also, it is trading below its crucial moving averages. The daily RSI has given a breakdown of upward sloping trendline. Hence, we believe the stock is likely to continue its southward journey and test the level of Rs 1,000 in the short term.
The stock has slipped below its 100-day EMA level on Friday, which is a bearish sign. In the recent pullback, the daily RSI has failed to cross 60 mark and thereafter slipped below 40 mark, which is a bearish sign as per RSI range shift rules. The daily MACD histogram is suggesting pickup in downside momentum. Hence, we believe it is likely to continue its southward journey and test the level of 145 in the short term."

Although these higher rates for Indian goods are effective from August 1, as per the order, they will not be applicable for those shipments already in transit before August 7 and are scheduled to arrive by October 5.
This means that most of the Indian goods which are in transit can continue paying duties at the earlier rates of 10-percent, and will face Trump's 25-percent after October 5.
The executive order mentions that tariffs may be reduced once countries conclude a deal with the US.
India and US continue to negotiate the terms of a Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA), which is aimed to be concluded by Fall of this year.
The US has also laid down rules that define goods that are rerouted or trans-shipped to evade higher duties, and will face a 40-percent levy in addition to base taxes.
This means, if an Indian-origin good is routed through a third country, it may face even higher tariffs.
Indian exports to the US stood at $86.51 billion in FY25.
According to GTRI estimates, India’s goods exports in FY26 may come down by 30-percent to $60.6 billion due to fresh tariffs imposed by the US.
Engineering goods, gems and jewellery, pharmaceuticals, ready-made garments and chemicals are some of India's top outbound shipments to America.
These new tariffs are expected to hit India's labour-intensive exports the most, notably textiles, gems and jewellery, as well as leather. The impact will likely amount to almost $20 billion in FY26.
However, there are exemptions for Indian exports. These include pharmaceuticals, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), electronics and ICT goods (semiconductors, smartphones, and computers) and energy products (crude oil, LNG, refined fuels, electricity, coal).
Therefore, if an Indian export falls under one of these sectors, it is not subject to the 25-percent tariff and continues to enjoy zero-duties.
This roughly amounts to around $30 billion in Indian exports to the US, which will fall under these exempted categories. But, this treatment is at risk since Trump's administration has threatened increasing duties on foreign-made drugs and electronics in the near-future.
However, steel and aluminium, and certain automobiles and auto parts will continue to face 50-percent and 25-percent sectoral tariffs, respectively as has been the case since April.
India's top export to the US is engineering goods that heavily relies on steel and aluminium products, worth almost $20 billion in FY25.
To be sure, while Trump had announced a penalty on India over and above the tariffs for purchasing Russian arms and energy, the nature and quantum of that additional penalty is yet to specified."

Indian equity markets ended the week on a muted note, mirroring the global risk-off sentiment triggered by renewed trade tensions. The Nifty 50 declined 0.8% over the week, extending its underperformance relative to global peers. Broader market weakness was more pronounced, with the Nifty Midcap and Smallcap indices slipping 1.2% and 1.7%, respectively.
The downturn came amid heightened global uncertainty after the U.S. imposed fresh tariffs on a range of countries, including 25% duties on Indian exports, while maintaining existing exemptions.
Additionally, President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement of 40% tariffs on transshipped goods ahead of the August 1 deadline added to investor jitters.
The Indian rupee depreciated 1.2% against the U.S. dollar over the week, reflecting currency market pressure.
On the sectoral front, FMCG emerged as the lone bright spot, gaining 3%, driven by defensive positioning and resilient earnings prints. In contrast, real estate (-5.5%), telecom (-4.2%), IT (-2.5%), pharma (-2.9%), and metals (-3.1%) dragged the indices lower on growth concerns and disappointing quarterly commentary."

The Railways earned Rs 3,129.49 crore in 2024-25 from the commercial use of its land, the minister said in a written reply.
Vaishnaw was replying to questions regarding the use of railway land for commercial purposes.
""A total of about 4.90 lakh hectare of land is owned by Indian Railways, out of which, about 0.22% (1,078 hectare) of railway land is under encroachment and about 1% (4,930 hectare) railway land is under utilisation for commercial purposes, including land entrusted to RLDA (Rail Land Development Authority) for commercial utilisation,"" Vaishnaw said.

At the launch, India Post stated that Aadhaar-based face authentication is expected to make digital banking more secure and convenient especially for the elderly and differently abled people.
The face authentication feature for Aadhar was developed under the framework of UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India).
Face-based authentication will help enable customers to perform banking transactions using facial recognition, and eliminate the need for physical biometric inputs like fingerprints or OTPs.
India Post said authentication by facial recognition will help banking for the elderly, differently-abled, and individuals who have worn fingerprints and faced difficulties in doing transactions.
While launching the feature, IPPB MD and CEO R Viswesvaran said, ""At IPPB, we believe that banking should not just be accessible, but dignified too. With Aadhaar-based face authentication, we are ensuring that no customer is left behind due to limitations in biometric fingerprints or OTP verification. It's a step towards redefining financial inclusion at scale.""
India Post said this secure Aadhaar authentication without needing an OTP or fingerprint sensors will also enable safe banking during health emergencies (like the recent Covid pandemic), where physical contact may be risky."

At mid-session, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down over 580 points, or 1.3%. The S&P 500 dropped 1.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite slid 1.9%, with tech and bank stocks leading the declines. High-growth names like Amazon fell more than 7% on weak profit guidance, while Nvidia, Meta, Alphabet and Tesla all traded deep in the red.
Investor sentiment soured after July’s nonfarm payrolls came in at just 73,000, missing estimates by a wide margin. Revisions to prior months painted an even grimmer picture—June's job gains were slashed to 14,000 from 147,000, while May’s tally was cut to just 19,000.
Markets swiftly repriced expectations for a Fed policy shift. CME FedWatch now reflects a 75.5% probability of a rate cut in September, up from 40% on Thursday. Prediction platform Kalshi shows a similar swing, with rising bets on a 25bps or even deeper cut.
Despite the economic miss, the White House offered a defiant defence. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said inflation had cooled and the private sector was growing under President Trump’s America First agenda. She repeated calls for the Fed to “cut rates so our economy can continue to boom,” even as new import duties took effect at midnight.
The fresh tariffs—ranging from 10% to 41%—target a broad swathe of countries and goods, with Canada seeing duties raised from 25% to 35%. Analysts fear the twin shocks of economic weakness and aggressive protectionism could steer the US toward recession.
Banking stocks were hit hard on fears of a credit pullback, with JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs each down 3.5–4%. GE Aerospace and Caterpillar fell around 3% amid industrial growth concerns.
Europe reels from tariff escalation
European markets mirrored the turmoil, suffering their worst session since April. The Stoxx 600 index closed down 1.8%, led by losses in banks (-2.9%) and travel (-2.7%). Industrial and consumer cyclical sectors also slumped.
Swiss luxury and pharma stocks were particularly hard-hit after the White House imposed a 39% tariff on Swiss goods. Richemont, Swatch, and Watches of Switzerland were seen as most exposed. Pharma majors including Novo Nordisk, AstraZeneca, and Novartis all fell 3–4% after Trump sent letters demanding lower US drug prices.
Even a 35% jump in British Airways-owner IAG’s Q2 profit couldn’t lift the stock, which ended nearly 2% lower amid macroeconomic headwinds.
Currency and sentiment reactions
The euro rose nearly 1% against the dollar as rate-cut bets surged post-jobs report. Back home, the University of Michigan’s sentiment index rose slightly to 61.7, while inflation expectations eased to multi-month lows. The ISM manufacturing index, however, dipped to 48, adding to signs of a slowdown.
More than 25 S&P 500 stocks hit fresh 52-week lows, including Chipotle, Lululemon, Dow Inc., and UnitedHealth. Only a handful, like Altria and Northrop Grumman, managed to post gains.
With global equities under pressure and macro signals flashing red, all eyes now turn to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and the central bank’s September decision."

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/decoding-india-s-dead-economy-for-mr-trump-13371206.html,Decoding 'India's dead economy' for Mr Trump,2025-08-01 22:29:00,"India being the fastest growing major economy doesn’t make it a ""dead economy"" in any sense, reckon economists and analysts. They say the country is poised to be the only second country after China that will drive the global GDP growth by 2030.
To be sure, India’s economy is expected to grow at 6.5% in FY26, according to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) – a rate same as in FY25.
On Thursday, US President Donald Trump called India and Russia a ""dead economy"".
""I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care. We have done very little business with India, their Tariffs are too high, among the highest in the World,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.
Economists, however disagree, and say the world’s fourth largest economy can’t be called ""dead"" in any sense. IMF has projected India’s GDP to cross $6.8 trillion by 2030.
""A country with the potential growth of 6.5-7%, which will soon be the 3rd largest economy in the world, driven by a young workforce…is far from a dead economy,"" Dhiraj Nim, economist, ANZ Research. At present, India is fourth largest economy in the world with GDP exceeding $4.187 trillion.
India’s general government debt is 81% of its GDP, while that of US is 120%. India’s household debt is also lower, at 42% of the GDP, while that of US is 69%. The former’s household (HH) savings rate, on the contrary, is much higher at 18.1% (of GDP), as compared to 4% of US.
""The HH savings rate gives India a clear edge,"" noted NR Bhanumurthy, director, Madras School of Economics. ""High savings powers consumption, and helps in financing domestic investment requirements. If savings are high, you don’t have to depend much on external financing, which is volatile,"" he added.
India’s debt-to-GDP ratio, in fact, is much lower than other advanced economies, such as Japan and China – both having debt over 200% of GDP. ""India’s government much more fiscally prudent, which makes is not a dead economy,"" noted Paras Jasrai, senior economic analyst, India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra).
Analysts say India’s progress on the digital payment framework empowers the country’s growth to accelerate and be inclusive. In June, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said India has 87% fintech adoption rate compared to 67% globally.
Sitharaman had noted that India has achieved 80% financial inclusion rate in ""just six years"" which in normal course will take 50 years. ""Nearly half of all real time digital transactions of the world are happening in India with 35 crore active users being a part of UPI system,"" said the FM.
""Financial inclusion helps in reducing cost of borrowing, and increase the money multiplier effect, which propels growth,"" said Bhanumurthy.
Analysts say, India will become one of the largest consumption markets in the coming years given it positive demographic dividend. For the next 20 years the working age population of India will continue to rise, and in contrast the US is an aging economy, they say.
""India is also key provider of skilled services such as software which keeps cost of funds for US companies contained,"" noted Gaura Sen Gupta, chief economist, IDFC FIRST Bank. ""India’s macro stability indicators are much healthier than the US with low external debt, low current account deficit and central fiscal deficit on a consolidation path,"" she added."
